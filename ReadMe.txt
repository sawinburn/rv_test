Comments:
First off, this was my first time working with npm, node.js, mocha, javascript, and pretty much every thing I touched during this assessment. I left my comments at the top of each file reflecting the things I would do to improve the code if I had the knowledge, struggles that I had with each section, and just general thoughts on the problems I ran across. Some of these modules will fail and some of that is due to problems with the code. What I am submitting is not a finalized-for-use draft, but a copy of my work at what I think is a good stage to discuss it.

I divided this exercise up into the provided testing guidelines. If I was to redo this from scratch, that may not be my approach. I would also try to pull out functions for re-use in a professional environment that may see a lot of repetition of testing. One thing I noticed towards the end of my work, as I trended away from trying to automate some of the testing and just manually entered in test cases, is that it shouldnt be as hard as I was making it (automating). I just needed more time than I gave myself for this exercise.
